# Module 8 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This respositorty contains the code for a weather dashboard application which uses the [5 Day Weather Forecast API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve data of the weather outlook for the current day as well as the five following days after. It also contains a functionality which allows users to look for multiple cities by saving search entries for easy comparison. Using what I had learned in class and self-study I was able to create an application that satisfy and fulfil these requirements:

```md
- A weather dashboard with form inputs.

  - When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

  - When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:

    - The city name
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
    - The wind speed

  - When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:

    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity

  - When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

I had also added further functionality which allows the user to clear their search history using a clear button.

## Thoughts and Improvements

Future changes that I think could really improve this scheduler:

```md
- Update the appearance of the dashboard itself.

- Change the clear functionality so that only certain cities can be cleared from history.

- Appearance/background changes depending on current weather of city (eg. A blurred rainy background for when current weather is rainy etc.)
```
